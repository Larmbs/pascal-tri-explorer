# Pascals Triangle Explorer
After watching a interesting video about 'what lies beyond [Pascals Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)' I was inspired to create a Pascal Triangle explorer so people can explore this shape for themselves. Here is the 
[Original Inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2daqMR3l24&t=769s) for this entire project, it is a must watch.

I wanted this to be accessible to anyone, thus I decided to use JavaScript for this project. Unfortunately because I am using JavaScript I have no control on the typing of variables, there is only a 'number' type without support for integers and unsigned integers.

Im sure we all know what Pascals Triangle is. It is a simple recursive operation on a list of numbers that hold a lot of meaning. Pascals Triangle is helpful in finding Binomial Coefficients, probability theory, and algebra.

In the video I watched from Dr. Baker. He extends the triangle in his own way upward. I have seen multiple people using for example 1/2, but I believe 1 is best represents this side of the triangle. In reality you can use any two numbers when A + B = 1, so you may have your own take on this. 

The source code for this is located on my github [here](https://github.com/Larmbs/pascal-tri-explorer) if you are interested.

> Note: I did not make the most optimal system, traveling to far out may be problematic memory wise as it caches every single factorial operation.
